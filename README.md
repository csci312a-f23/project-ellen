# Project Skeleton

## Development Environment

Need to set up a project with neon and add to your .env.local and .env.development.local file.
Run the following commands:
npx knex migrate:latest
npx knex seed:run
These will migrate and seed the database.
Then you should be able to run:
npm run dev
Docker should automatically start when you run npm run dev.
MiddHousing requires a Google authentication client id and client secret, and next auth key.

## Creation

This project skeleton has been setup similar to our assignments and practicals. It is a Next.JS application, created with create-next-app `ðŸ’» npx create-next-app@latest`, which uses Jest and Testing Library for testing, ESLint for static analysis, Prettier for styling, and is configured to use GitHub actions for testing pull requests.

Development dependencies installed with:

```
ðŸ’» npm install -D jest jest-environment-jsdom husky lint-staged prettier eslint-config-prettier @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
ðŸ’» npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
ðŸ’» npm install -D eslint-import-resolver-alias
```

Other dependencies installed with:

```
ðŸ’» npm install -S prop-types
```

### Additional tools you might need

#### Mocking fetch

Tools for mocking fetch can be installed with

```
ðŸ’» npm install -D fetch-mock-jest node-fetch@2.6.7
```

Note we need to pin the `node-fetch` version due to breaking changes when used with Jest in newer versions.
